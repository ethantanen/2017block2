1)	Speedup is a measure of the difference in performance between two machines completing the same problem. Speedup is defined as the ratio between the runtime of machine 1 over the runtime for machine 2. Sp=T1/Tp

2)	Efficiency measures the amount of time a processor is used. It is the ratio of speedup to the number of processors.  efficiency = T1/(P*Tp)

3)

a: 3
b: 6 tasks * 5 sec/task = 30 sec
c: T1=6, T2=4
	speedup: T1/T2*5sec = 7.5sec
	efficiency: 30/(20*2)= .75 —> 75% 
d:T1=6, T4=3
	speedup: T1/T4*5sec = 10sec
	efficiency: 30/(15*4) = .5 —> 50%
e:T1=6 T10=3
	speedup: T1/T10*5sec = 10sec
	efficiency:  30/(50*10) = .06  —> 6%
f: 
	T1=6p —> 30sec
	-a 10x speed up would reduce the execution time down to 3 sec
	T1/T? * 5sec = 3sec —-> 6p/T?*5sec = 3sec —> T? = 10p
	-there would need to be 8 total parallel processors in the parallel region. 


4)
a: 	-latency = time it takes to satisfy transfer request = time it takes to get to memory + time it takes for memory to retrieve data + time it takes to get back to the processor

	time it takes to get to memory: (.1 meters / c(m/s)) = 3.4 * 10^-10
	time it takes for memory to retrieve data: 1tick/3Ghz = 3.4 * 10^-10

	latency = 10 * 10^-10 seconds 


	-# of clicks = latency/ghz (convenient bc constant ghz)
clock ticks to travel to and from memory:
	(.1 meters / c(m/s)) / 3Ghz=  1 tick

	total ticks = 1 tick there + 1 tick to retrieve + 1 tick to return = 3ticks

b: bandwidth amount of information per unit time

3G tick/s
128 bits wide = 16bytes wide 

1 tick = 16bytes bussed 

16bytes/tick * 3*10^9ticks/sec = 4.8 * 10^10
